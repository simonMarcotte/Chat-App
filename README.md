## Usage

To use this app, click the button `Sign in With Google` to log in to your account. Once you sign in, you will be redirected to your home screen.

You can click the `New Chat` button to create a chat with anyone. You _must_ know the email of the person you wish to chat with. The chat will appear in your list of chats once you enter the email in the popup and click `ok`.


## Wishlist

Here are some features to be implemented in the future:
- Sidebar profile pictures, and user's names associated with their google account
- Remove chat button, with confirmation popup to delete a full chat and its history
